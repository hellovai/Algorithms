Proofs by Contradiction
	Prove there are an infinite number of primes.
		-> Take set of known primes
		-> take x = product(known primes) + 1
		-> prove x [if not prime] cannot be not prime (contradiction)
		-> prove x [if prime] is larger than largest prime

	The set (0,1) = {x: 0<x<1 } is uncountable
		-> Diagonalization, show a number that cannot exist in the list

	There is an uncountable number of functions from the positive integer to {0,1}
		-> Diagonalization

Countable vs finitie
	(1,2,3) - finite
	{1, 2, 3, ..., } - uncountable

infinite - a set which has a 1 - to - 1 mapping of itself to a proper subset

Proof by Induction
	Meh
	style matters
		- inductive hypothesis
		- check base case
